									<p>Currently, I am working on topics of environmental microeconomics and innovation. The core areas of my investigation include eco-innovation and the role of new technologies in 
										steering the green transition, as well as markets for carbon credits and transition policies for carbon-intensive sectors. As a reference sector I am currently covering 
										the air transport and the supply chain challenges it is facing to reduce net emissions by means of integration of sustainable aviation fuels. I am also working on carbon 
										capture & storage technologies and their impacts on firms active in the oil and energy industries. I am interested in inequalities and social implications of green 
										economic policies. I mainly work with data.</p>
									<p>Below you can find working papers with links to latest available drafts as well as ideas I would like to develop in the next future. </p>

									<h2><strong>Working Papers</strong></h2>
									<h3><i>Does carbon capture & storage mitigate carbon premium? Evidence from patents (with L. Rondi, 2024)</i></h3>
									<p>We study firm-level patenting in Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) technologies and its effect on firms' stock market performance. Joining patent data with balance-sheet, 
										financial and non-financial company panel data (2010-2022), we use zero-inflated Poisson regressions to study CCS patent activity both at the extensive and at the 
										intensive margin. We find that CCS patents behave consistently with other eco - innovations and respond to the environmental pressure exercised by firm-level 
										CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and by country-level environmental regulatory policy. Then, motivated by the recent debate about the existence of a "carbon risk premium"
										in the stock market, we investigate how CCS patenting affects firms' market value and the risk premium requested by investors to high-carbon emitters. We find that 
										CCS patenting is negatively (positively) related to the market-to-book ratio (stock returns). 
										However, the effect is mitigated if the patenting firm is a high CO<sub>2</sub> emitter and if the regulatory environmental pressure intensifies, suggesting that 
										CCS innovation may reduce the carbon risk premium required by the capital markets to firms with a "browner" reputation.</p>
									
									<h3><i>Government financing and innovation crowding-out in the EU CCS sector (2024)</i></h3>
									<p>This paper explores the interplay between government subsidies and private innovation within the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) industry, particularly focusing on how 
										regional sectoral integration and concentration influence innovation output. Regions with more integrated industrial sectors are expected to utilize sector-specific funds 
										more efficiently, fostering innovation. Conversely, concentrated sectors, with strong barriers to entry, might reduce innovation efforts to maximize profits from existing 
										technologies. To investigate these hypotheses, sectoral integration and concentration indexes for the CCS industry are computed using various economic indicators at the 
										EU regional level. A Poisson panel regression analysis is employed to test the impact of these factors on innovation output. The results indicate that while the 
										anticompetitive effect of concentration is generally insignificant, sectoral integration positively influences innovation. 
										However, when considering non-linear interactions with policy incentives, the data reveals a nuanced picture: higher policy incentives tend to crowd out 
										private innovation in concentrated sectors, whereas they stimulate innovation in highly integrated sectors. 
										These findings highlight the importance of sectoral structure in shaping the effectiveness of government subsidies on fostering innovation.</p>
