									<p>Currently, I am working on topics of environmental microeconomics and innovation. The core areas of my investigation include eco-innovation and the role of new technologies in 
										steering the green transition, as well as markets for carbon credits and transition policies for carbon-intensive sectors. As a reference sector I am currently covering 
										the air transport and the supply chain challenges it is facing to reduce net emissions by means of integration of sustainable aviation fuels. I am also working on carbon 
										capture & storage technologies and their impacts on firms active in the oil and energy industries. I am interested in inequalities and social implications of green 
										economic policies. I mainly work with data.</p>
									<p>Below you can find working papers with links to latest available drafts as well as ideas I would like to develop in the next future. </p>

									<h2><strong>Working Papers</strong></h2>
									<h3><i>Does carbon capture & storage mitigate carbon premium? Evidence from patents (with L. Rondi, 2024)</i></h3>
									<p>We study firm-level patenting in Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) technologies and its effect on firms' stock market performance. Joining patent data with balance-sheet, 
										financial and non-financial company panel data (2010-2022), we use zero-inflated Poisson regressions to study CCS patent activity both at the extensive and at the 
										intensive margin. We find that CCS patents behave consistently with other eco - innovations and respond to the environmental pressure exercised by firm-level 
										CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and by country-level environmental regulatory policy. Then, motivated by the recent debate about the existence of a "carbon risk premium"
										in the stock market, we investigate how CCS patenting affects firms' market value and the risk premium requested by investors to high-carbon emitters. We find that 
										CCS patenting is negatively (positively) related to the market-to-book ratio (stock returns). 
										However, the effect is mitigated if the patenting firm is a high CO<sub>2</sub> emitter and if the regulatory environmental pressure intensifies, suggesting that 
										CCS innovation may reduce the carbon risk premium required by the capital markets to firms with a "browner" reputation.</p>
									
									<h3><i>Government financing and innovation crowding-out in the EU CCS sector (2024)</i></h3>
									<p>This paper explores the interplay between government subsidies and private innovation within the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) industry, particularly focusing on how 
										regional sectoral integration and concentration influence innovation output. Regions with more integrated industrial sectors are expected to utilize sector-specific funds 
										more efficiently, fostering innovation. Conversely, concentrated sectors, with strong barriers to entry, might reduce innovation efforts to maximize profits from existing 
										technologies. To investigate these hypotheses, sectoral integration and concentration indexes for the CCS industry are computed using various economic indicators at the 
										EU regional level. A Poisson panel regression analysis is employed to test the impact of these factors on innovation output. The results indicate that while the 
										anticompetitive effect of concentration is generally insignificant, sectoral integration positively influences innovation. 
										However, when considering non-linear interactions with policy incentives, the data reveals a nuanced picture: higher policy incentives tend to crowd out 
										private innovation in concentrated sectors, whereas they stimulate innovation in highly integrated sectors. 
										These findings highlight the importance of sectoral structure in shaping the effectiveness of government subsidies on fostering innovation.</p>
										
									<h3><i> Green and brown CCUS patents. Is the stock market color-blind? (with L.Rondi, 2025)</i></h3>
									<p> This paper investigates if the stock market acknowledges the difference between green and non-green innovation in Carbon Capture Utilization & Storage (CCUS) technolo-
										gies by requiring a different carbon risk premium to patenting firms. Building on evidence that CCUS patents reduce the carbon risk premium of companies with higher
										CO2 emissions (Barchi and Rondi, 2024), we focus on the environmental content of CCUS patents by discriminating between green and non-green patents. Matching
										patent data with financial and CO2 emission data for a worldwide panel of CCUS patenting listed companies (2010-2021), we estimate the impact of green and ”brown”
										patents on firm market value and total returns. Results confirm that the carbon-risk mitigating effect of CCUS patenting is stronger within carbon-intensive firms. However,
										there is weak evidence that stock markets discern the ”colour” of CCUS patents, as our (preliminary) results show that, for high emitters, both kinds of innovations are valu-
										able for the stock market. This suggests different motivations behind the appreciation of the innovative effort, one that awards a forward-looking view for truly green patents
										and the other compensating the value-maximization view for non-green patents that reduce the transition costs or enhance fuel efficiency of high-emitting firms in carbon-
										intensive industries. So in the end, the stock market could be cross-eyed instead of colorblind.</p>

								    <h3><i> Green transition and decarbonization projects: Are we doing enough? (with L.Rondi & M.Illich, 2025)</i></h3>
									<p> Carbon Capture Utilization & Storage (CCUS) technologies are viewed as crucial to unravel the full potential of decarbonization and reach carbon neutrality (UNECE, 2021), 
										but completion of effective projects is difficult and expensive, suggesting that public policies are needed to subsidize these initiatives. Leveraging on the CCUS projects 
										database published by IEA, we provide an in-depth analysis of the geographical and sectoral distribution, stakeholders and companies’ involvement, fate of carbon and deployment 
										pace of worldwide CCUS projects from 1990 to 2023. Going more in depth, we focus on the divergent development of the CCUS between EU and US (major players in the sector) in relation 
										to their different policy frameworks. Our evidence shows a significant uptrend in CCUS projects in Western countries, particularly in the oil & gas, agrochemical,
										and materials industries. When we focus on the leaders in the industry, we find that even the largest ones cooperate through Joint Ventures within hubs to leverage their business
									    and core competencies synergistically, thereby increasing the probability of successful responses to public call-to-actions. Results show diverse performance for CCUS depending on
										geographical, policy-, sector- and firm-level features. Finally, we tentatively evaluate the GHG emission reduction potentially achievable through the surveyed CCUS projects by 2030,
										and find that, compared to international climate targets, the number and scale of planned projects are insufficient to boost total capture capacity, suggesting that also the efficiency
										of capture technologies has to be increased. </p>
